		<p>This app controls your tabs! Drag your tabs into this app
		to save them for later so you don't have to leave them open
		in your browser! Don't suffer anymore by leaving dozens of tabs
		open in your browser. Let us do the work by storing your tabs
		here!</p>
		<p>Don't forget to organize your idea into <em>sessions</em>!
		For instance, you could create a "Shopping" session with Amazon,
		Ebay, etc. Then you could boot up all those sites at once right
		into the browser!</p>
